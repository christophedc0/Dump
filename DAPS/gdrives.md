### More details

#### *Hybrid* drive(s)

Whenever a drive contains > 50% posters that are being collected from others, their priority should be set to lowest

##### Example

A nice example of this is my (Chris DC) drive.

It contains a few homemade posters, personal favorites as sometimes posters have slight variations or have been remade by others and then it falls into the collection of others.

In the list, since I know the posters are correctly made, they're above any other drive that is in the lowest priority, but also below any drive that contains > 50% custom made posters by the owner(s).

######  How is this reflected in reality?

At this point, this drive is my custom folder/drive and personal for me.

My (Chris DC) drive is set to the highest priority, since it is my drive and I prefer to see these posters instead of another poster.

#### When would you change priority for yourself?

So now you're wondering, why should I follow this baseline? What happens if I change the order of these drives?

##### Example

You're using this baseline in your configuration, but you have posters like:

*Before*

![](../Screenshots/DAPS/IMG_0483.jpeg)
![](../Screenshots/DAPS/Screenshot_2024-05-10_at_21.51.37.PNG)

You don't like these posters and you figured out that there are other posters available or made for it.
* These can be found with using `poster_search.sh` or browsing and downloading them from the internet.
* If they're on a drive in the list you can change the priority and rerun everything.

But if it was that simple.. they might have posters that you personally don't like..

Here comes the custom folder in place, you just move the posters you want to replace to your custom folder, rerun everything et voila!

*After*
